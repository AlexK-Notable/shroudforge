/* Optional host interface of kfc-runtime.dll (Kiln fork, dev.21). It does not change KFC_RUNTIME_ABI_VERSION: a host that
 * does not know it never calls KfcRuntimeSetHost, and kfc-runtime behaves exactly as before.
 *
 * Why it exists. kfc-runtime hooks up to six places in the game's code (game_thread, entity_manager, world_prop_update,
 * world_actor_placement, world_building_dispatch and world_cursor, named by the game profile). On its own it finds each
 * place in the live code and installs a jump only when the live bytes are still the profile's originals, so any DLL that
 * hooked one of those places first makes it refuse (and with it the whole native runtime). A host that already owns the
 * game's code hooks (Kiln's kiln.hooks) can instead find the place in the exe FILE's bytes and put the hook in its own
 * chain, which runs next to or in front of the other DLL's jump.
 *
 * Use. Call KfcRuntimeSetHost(&host) once, before KfcRuntimeInitialize (the hooks are installed by Initialize). It copies
 * the table (the function pointers must stay valid until KfcRuntimeShutdown). A false result means the table was refused
 * (too small, a null function): kfc-runtime keeps hooking the game itself. KfcRuntimeSetHost(NULL) takes the host away
 * again for the next Initialize.
 *
 * With a host, kfc-runtime does not look at the live bytes at all: find_signature decides whether the place exists, and
 * install_hook places the hook. Every callback below is the same function the self-installed trampoline calls.
