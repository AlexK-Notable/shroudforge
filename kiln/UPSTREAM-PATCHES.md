# Edits to upstream files (keep this list short)

Every change to a file outside `kiln/` is listed here with one line, so a merge from upstream stays cheap. Everything
else Kiln needs lives in `kiln/`.

| File | Change | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `modules/entrypoints/build_windows_app_icon.rs` | tracks `SHROUDFORGE_NO_APP_ICON` and skips the icon resource when it is set | winres needs `rc.exe`, which a Linux cross build (cargo xwin) lacks; the runtime DLL needs no icon. Upstream behaviour unchanged without the variable. |
| `modules/game-runtime/native/engine-hooks/install_engine_hooks.cpp` (+ `.h`) | optional host path: with a table from `KfcRuntimeSetHost` the six engine hooks are found and placed by the host (`find_signature`, `install_hook`, `remove_hook`) instead of by SF's own scan and trampolines; `Uninstall` removes host hooks through the host. Without a host nothing changes. | Kiln hosts SF's hooks in `kiln.hooks`, so a DLL that hooked a place first does not switch SF's native runtime off. |
| `modules/game-runtime/native/abi/runtime_host.h` (new) | the host table and `KfcRuntimeSetHost` | the interface above; `KFC_RUNTIME_ABI_VERSION` stays 12 (an optional export) |
| `modules/game-files/game_file_transaction.rs` | publication replaces each file with one rename and keeps the previous target when that fails; recovery checks the staging folder, the rollback copies and the journal before it deletes or replaces a file, and refuses linked paths and malformed or duplicate journal entries; tests | dev.20: startup archive publication failed on Windows and under Wine, and recovery could follow a link out of the game folder. |
| `modules/mod-runtime/session/asset_resources.rs`, `session/mod.rs`, `session/create_mod_session.rs` | the asset reader is an `Option`; `commit_assets` and `Drop` close it (and the writer) before the transaction publishes or rolls back; tests `asset_transaction_tests` | dev.20: the runtime's own open handles blocked the replacement of the live archives. Upstream 1.8.0 closes them itself (`reader()` returns a `Result`): when merging 1.8.0 take upstream's side in these files and keep the tests (their fixture then needs upstream's new `AppState` field). |
| `modules/hotkeys/observe_keyboard.rs` | host feed inside `mod windows` (`host_begin`, `host_key`, `host_mouse_button`, `host_reset`, `host_end`, one block before the tests); while a host feeds, `initialize` starts neither SDL input nor the helper process, and a helper reader that ends or comes up late leaves the host's state alone. Without `host_begin` nothing changes. | Kiln's bundled component has no `shroudforge.exe`, so the `--keyboard-input` helper could not start and every mod keybind answered "not held". Kiln passes the game window's own key records instead. |
| `modules/hotkeys/host_input.rs`, `modules/hotkeys/host_keyboard.c` (new) | the seven exported `shroudforge_input_host_*` functions (`kiln/abi/input_host.h`) and their key translation with SDL's Windows scan-code table | the interface above; optional exports of `shroudforge-runtime.dll` |
| `modules/hotkeys/lib.rs`, `modules/hotkeys/build.rs` | `mod host_input;` and `host_keyboard.c` added to the adapter's sources | wiring for the two new files |
| `modules/entrypoints/loader/embedded.rs` | `recycle_incompatible_game_asset_backups` first asks `working_baseline::set_aside_without_updater`; `mod kiln_tests` | After a game update ShroudForge has its Updater move the outdated working backups (`<stem>.kfc.bak`, `<stem>.kfc_resources.bak`) to the recycle bin. Kiln's bundled component has no Updater, so that step, and with it every asset preparation after a game update, failed. An installation (Updater or installed runtime library present) keeps upstream's path and messages. |
| `modules/game-files/set_aside_working_baseline.rs` (new), `modules/game-files/lib.rs` (`pub mod working_baseline`) | moves the outdated pair and kiln-eml's seal of it to `<game>/shroudforge/backups/outdated-working-baseline/<stem>/<generation>/`, header backup last, one generation kept | the replacement for the Updater's recycle step above |
| `modules/entrypoints/loader/kiln_tests.rs` (new) | the loader-side tests of that path, one with real small archives of two game versions (Wine) | |
| `modules/mod-runtime/startup/manage_asset_baseline.rs` | `create_backup` and `create_companion_backup` copy through `copy_complete`: to `<backup>.partial`, flushed, then renamed; one test | A start that ended during the copy of the resource file left a part of it under the backup's name. Every later restore took it for a whole backup and copied it over the game's file. The new path above makes that copy after every game update. |

Not patched, handled in `kiln/` instead:
- `modules/game-runtime/native/CMakeLists.txt`: its generated license resource script quotes the resource names, which
  llvm-rc refuses. `kiln/native/CMakeLists.txt` rewrites the generated file after configure.
- The test of the host path: `kiln/native/tests/engine_hooks_host_test.cpp`, target `kfc-runtime-test-engine-hooks` in
  `kiln/native/CMakeLists.txt` (Wine, no game).
- The tests of the host key feed are in `modules/hotkeys/host_input.rs` itself (they need the crate's private state):
  `cargo xwin test -p shroudforge-hotkeys --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` under Wine.
